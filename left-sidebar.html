											<h3>Goals</h3>


											<h4>Short Term Goals</h4>
											<p>As each semester goes on, I want to expand my knowledge not only for my career but also for my hobby and love for technology. As I continue to pursue classes in the field of Electrical Engineering, specifically in Electrical Energy Systems and Electronic Device. I will also pursue two minors, one in Spanish as I plan to study abroad in Spain in Spring 2023, and I already have studied in Puerto Rico during Summer 2022. As well as another minor in Computer Science where I will learn more about machine learning and be able to use computers to the fullest to solve engineering problems. 

												Moreover, semester by semester I want to learn a new hobby or skill. Whether it be a new machine or new coding language I want to become proficient in a variety of things which would allow me to be more creative in my innovation. For my first semester I learned how to design and fabricate Printed Circuit Boards. In the following semesters I plan to learn CAD, laser engraving, and more coding languages. Using what I learn from the previous semester to advance my learning in the following semesters.
												</p>
											<h4>Long Term Goals</h4>
											<p>I want to combine my passions into my career, with that being said I want to work in a field in which creativity and ingenuity combine. I want to combine my love for the outdoors with my love for technology and work on making products, devices, and systems that are efficient and sustainable. As well as an environment that promotes collaboration and the enabling of diverse ideas in order to find ingenuitive solutions to some of the world’s most challenging problems. I want to help as many people around the world as possible hence learning Spanish so I can work in many countries around the world and with a growing number of people in the US.</p>

											<h3>Intro</h3>
											<p>My name is Joseph Gabel, and I am a second year Electrical Engineering major at Georgia Institute of Technology, ironically my initials are JPEG which I find very fitting considering my interest in technology. I grew up on Long Island, New York in a suburban town about an hour East of New York City. I went to a public high school with a diverse population of kids, leading to many lifelong bonds with people from different backgrounds and beliefs.</p>

											<h3>My love for technology simplified</h3>
											<p> Growing up I loved technology; I had a leapfrog as a kid that I loved and played with for hours. Nothing could entertain me as much as technology could, whether it was a light up toy or a computer, I was always fascinated by technology. I started playing videogames as I got older playing games with friends on consoles like the Xbox 360. Eventually, in 7th grade I built my first computer after months of researching how to build them. Soon after, in 9th grade I built my first drone with the help of some friends who had more experience in the field. In 10th grade I made my first practical Arduino device after tinkering with them for years, and I’ve only been working with more technology since then. From CAD to PCB fabrication my love for technology is expansive and endless. If you want to see some of the things I’ve done with technology, then check out my projects! </p>
											

											<h3>Electrical Engineering</h3>
											<p>In 2021 I started my first year at Georgia Tech, a massive college in midtown Atlanta filled to the brim with nerds like myself. I chose to major in Electrical Engineering because I want to work with software and hardware. I always enjoyed the software classes I did in school, but I more so enjoyed the hands-on projects I did in clubs or on my own time such as soldering or Arduino or building computers for friends. A combination of the two lead me to decide on majoring in Electrical Engineering. </p>
