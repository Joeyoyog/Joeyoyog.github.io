											<h4 style="margin-bottom:0%;">China</h4>
											<p>Traveling is a passion I have had the fortune of enjoying for a long time. Whether it was a road trip to a city on the East coast or taking a 16-hour flight to the other side of the world, I always loved the idea of visiting and exploring a new place. In the Summer of 2019 at age 15, I was given the opportunity to travel with my friend and his dad to China. It was a challenging and life changing experience since the only person who spoke Mandarin and English fluently was my friend. I spent 16 days traveling around the country from their home province in Fujian to Shanghai, even inland to Hunan. It was an amazing experience that gave me a global perspective that has changed the way I see the world. </p>

											<h4 style="margin-bottom:0%;">Puerto Rico</h4>
											<p>Being Puerto Rican, this was a trip I wanted to do for a long time, so when I heard that there was a 5-week study abroad in Puerto Rico I jumped on the opportunity to go. We studied Latin American Music and Iboamerican Cities at the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras. It was a lot of work, each day we would have classes, homework, and excursions to places all over the island. However, it was well worth the work and my Spanish improved a lot. Moreover, I was able to connect to a culture that was mostly lost due to the practices of assimilation at the time my family immigrated to the US.</p>

											<h4 style="margin-bottom:0%;">Camping</h4>


											<p>Scouting is the most likely origin of my love for traveling and exploring, I did Scouting for 10 years and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in 2020. I loved going on a different excursion to a different location every month and getting to explore a new place. We would travel up and down the New England States and because of all my time spent camping I have a large appreciation for nature as well as a desire to maintain our ecosystem so others can enjoy it. </p>

											<h4>Sports</h4>
											<p>During my time in high school, I was on 2 sports teams, I was on the badminton team since freshman year and was on the first ever boys’ volleyball team which started my senior year. I played singles in badminton and by my 2nd year I was a top 5 player on our team of 25 boys. I was the #1 boy’s singles player for our very short 2020 season and our relatively normal 2021 season and went to counties in senior year to end up around 15th in the county. I love the sport and continue to play it casually at Georgia Tech. Volleyball was a sport I always wanted to play, so I was very excited when they announced tryouts for senior year. I played as an Outside hitter and our team almost made it to counties despite it being our very first year. I would love to play the sport more at Georgia Tech but it’s a lot larger time commitment. </p>
											
											<h4>Weight Lifting</h4>
											<p>Working out is something I started during Covid when I was given a lot of free time to dive into the hobby. Georgia Tech has a large Campus Recreation Center (CRC) which I attend 5-6 times a week usually with friends and occasionally on my own. I plan to maintain my passion for weightlifting as well as expand it into other areas such as rock climbing and martial arts. </p>

											<h4>Gaming</h4>
											<p>While I do not play games nearly as much as I once did, I must acknowledge the role it played in my interest with technology. One of the games that acted as a major influence was Minecraft, with its sandbox nature it gave me endless hours of fun. On top of that Minecraft was the first game I learned to modify, as in changing the game files to add content to the game. This is where my passion for coding started, learning to modify the game led me to learn to code as well as learning about making and hosting servers for me and my friends to play together.  </p>
